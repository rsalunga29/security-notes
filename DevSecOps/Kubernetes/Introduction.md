Kubernetes or k8s is a container orchestration system. It is a tool for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containers. Kubernetes is mostly used in microservices architecture, in which hundreds or even thousands of containers, need a technology to help manage and organize them.
## Benefits of K8s
Kubernetes allows an application to be highly available and scalable. It does this by duplicating an application (and its db component) and load balancing external requests to the application to an available resource, therefore removing a single point of failure.

Kubernetes is also highly portable in that it can be run anywhere with nearly any type of infrastructure and can be used in single or multi-cloud set.
