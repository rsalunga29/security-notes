## Config File
Kubernetes config files are typically written in YAML format (best practice). But, they can also be made interchangeably using the JSON format.

The following are the four fields which must be present in each of the YAML files:
### apiVersion
The version of the Kubernetes API you are going to use to create this object. The API version you use will depend on the object being defined. A cheatsheet for what API version to use for which object can be foundÂ [here](https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/articles/kubernetes-apiversion-definition-guide.html).
### kind
What kind of object you are going to create (e.g. Deployment, Service, StatefulSet).
### metadata
This will contain data that can be used to uniquely identify the object (including name and an optional namespace).
### spec
The desired state of the object (for deployment, this might be 3 nginx pods).
### example-service.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: example-nginx-service
spec:
	selector:
		app: nginx
	ports:
		- protocol: TCP
		  port: 8080
		  targetPort: 80
	type: ClusterIP
```
