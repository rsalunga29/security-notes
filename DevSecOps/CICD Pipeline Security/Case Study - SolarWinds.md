The SolarWinds breach was a significant cyberattack discovered in December 2020. The attackers compromised SolarWinds' software supply chain, injecting a malicious code known as SUNBURST into the company's Orion software updates.
## Prevention
The SolarWinds incident could have been prevented by implementing the following techniques:

**Implement Isolation and Segmentation Techniques**
By isolating and segmenting critical components within the build system, separating different stages of the build process and employing strict access controls, you can mitigate the risk of a single compromised component compromising the entire system.

Isolation can be achieved through containerization or virtualization technologies, creating secure sandboxes to execute build processes without exposing the entire environment.

**Setting up Appropriate Access Controls and Permissions**
Limited unauthorized access to build environments is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the system. By following the principle of least privilege, only grant access to individual or groups who require it to perform their specific tasks.

Implementing multi-factor authentication and enforcing strong password policy will also bolster account security of individuals or groups performing tasks within the build environments. It is also important to regularly review and update access controls to ensure that access privileges align with the principle of least privilege.

Implementing strict controls on privileged accounts is essential, including limiting the number of individuals with administrative access and strict monitoring and auditing mechanisms for privileged activities.
