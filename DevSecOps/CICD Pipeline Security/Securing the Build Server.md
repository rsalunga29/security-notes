The simplest measure to implement is to restrict access to it. There are many cases in which multiple members have access to the same build server. In these cases, we need to enforce granular access controls and follow the principle of least privilege, that way we ensure that a compromise of one user would not lead to compromise of all builds. Additionally, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) can reduce the risk of user accounts being compromised. Lastly, remember to change the default credentials of the build server.

The following steps can also be followed to protect the build servers and build agents:
1. **Build Agent Configuration**: Configure build agents to only communicate with the build server, avoiding external exposure.
2. **Private Network**: Place build agents within a private network, preventing direct internet access.
3. **Firewalls**: Employ firewalls to restrict incoming connections to necessary Build server-related traffic.
4. **VPN**: Use a VPN to access the build server and its agents securely from remote locations.
5. **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilize build agent tokens for authentication, adding an extra layer of security.
6. **SSH Keys**: For SSH-based build agents, use secure SSH keys for authentication.
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor build agent activities and logs for unusual behavior.
8. **Regular Updates**: Update both the build server and agents with security patches.
9. **Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
10. **Remove Defaults and Harden Configuration:** Make sure to harden your build server and remove all default credentials and weak configurations.
