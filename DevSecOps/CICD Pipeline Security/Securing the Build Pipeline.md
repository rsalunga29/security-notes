## Access Gates
Also known as gates or checkpoints, these serves as "stages" within the software development pipeline. They ensure that code progresses through the pipeline only after meeting predefined quality and security criteria. It provides the following advantages:
1. **Enhanced Control**: Access gates provide checkpoints in the pipeline, allowing controlled progression to different stages.
2. **Quality Control**: Gates ensures that code meets predefined quality standards before advancing.
3. **Security Checks**: Gates enables security assessments, such as vulnerability scans, before deployment
