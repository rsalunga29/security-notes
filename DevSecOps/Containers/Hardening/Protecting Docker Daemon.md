Docker daemon is responsible for processing requests such as managing containers and pulling or uploading images to a Docker registry. Docker can be managed remotely and is often done in CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Development)Â pipelines.

If an attacker can interact with the Docker daemon, they can interact with the containers and images. For example, they launch their own (malicious) containers or gain access to containers running applications with sensitive information (such as databases).
