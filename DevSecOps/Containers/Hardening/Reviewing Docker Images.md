Unfortunately, there are numerous examples of malicious Docker images causing havoc. For instance, in 2020, Palo Alto discovered [cryptomining Docker images](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cryptojacking-docker-images-for-mining-monero/) that were pulled (and presumably ran) over two million times. Thus, it is important to review Docker images before using them.

Images on Docker Hub often come with the Dockerfiles attached to the repository. Additionally, open-source code repositories for images on the Docker Hub will often be included, allowing you to review the entire Dockerfile.
