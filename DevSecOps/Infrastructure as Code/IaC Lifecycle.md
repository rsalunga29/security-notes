Currently, there is yet to be agreed-upon and widely adopted lifecycle. The actions/tasks performed by developers and IaC tools can be broken down into phases, which together make a lifecycle; this lifecycle helps us understand that infrastructure as code has continual and repeatable processes, which don't simply follow a linear sequence of provision and management tasks.
## Continual (Best Practice) Phase
![[continual-iac.png]]
These phases are continually done to ensure best practices throughout the various stages of infrastructure development and management. Continual phases can trigger repeatable phases (i.e Rollback).

| Phase Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Version Control        | This phase involves versioning code while defining your infrastructure and making changes. This way, when it comes to the later rollback phase, there are clearly defined versions to fall back on should a new change break something.                                                                                                      |
| Collaboration          | When working as part of a team on infrastructure, it is crucial to communicate and collaborate so everyone is on the same page. Otherwise, this can lead to a disconnect between modular infrastructure components or general confusion over infrastructure.                                                                                 |
| Monitoring/Maintenance | Once an infrastructure has been provisioned/configured, it must be monitored for poor performance, security events, failure events, warnings, etc. Automated maintenance tasks (e.g. disk clean-up) can help avoid some of these events. In certain events, this phase can trigger the rollback phase.                                       |
| Rollback               | In the event of a failure event post-deployment, the infrastructure will need to be rolled back to the last known working version.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Review + Change        | Just because an infrastructure works doesn’t mean it’s as efficient as it could be. Perhaps a new security vulnerability has been discovered, or maybe there’s a new business requirement that would benefit from an infrastructure change. Infrastructure should routinely be reviewed to determine if this is the case, and changed if so. |
## Repeatable (Infra Creation + Config) Phase
![[repeatable-iac.png]]
These phases are done during the creation/configuration of an infrastructure and are done one or many times at different points and with differing variations depending on what needs to be done.

| Phase Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design     | The infrastructure needs to be designed based on needs, taking security into account throughout the whole process (for example, poor scaling policy design can lead to availability issues, which is a huge security concern). |
| Define     | Use the design to define the infrastructure that needs to be provisioned in code.                                                                                                                                              |
| Test       | Using a linter, validate the code for syntax errors or logical issues. Before provisioning is done in production, test the infrastructure in a replica environment (staging).                                                  |
| Provision  | Provision the infrastructure that has been defined in the production environment using a provisioning tool, e.g. Terraform.                                                                                                    |
| Configure  | Configure the provisioned environment using a configuration management tool, e.g. Ansible.                                                                                                                                     |
