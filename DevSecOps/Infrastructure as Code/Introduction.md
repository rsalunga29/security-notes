Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and configuration of servers through code. This code can be used to define a "desired state" for the infrastructure, acting as a blueprint for IaC tools to provision the infrastructure.
## Benefits of IaC
### Scalable
IaC makes it easier for teams to scale up or down their infrastructure based on demand using a single command or even automate the process.
### Versionable
IaC can be versioned using a version control system, such as Git. Versioning an infrastructure means it's self-documenting, allowing changes to be tracked and recorded. Through versioning, it is also easy to rollback to a previous version should the current infrastructure encounters issues. Versioning infrastructure can also improve testing capabilities; for example, an application can be tested using a historical infrastructure build.
### Repeatable
Using IaC, it becomes easy to set up identical infrastructure across multiple environments with a single command. This allows teams to save massive amounts of times and ensures consistency and reliability across environments.
## IaC in Practice
### Infrastructure Automation
Since IaC allows the automation of the provisioning and configuration of an infrastructure, reprovisioning and re-configuring an infrastructure in a backup data centre is streamlined and less time-consuming.
### Data Backup and Recovery
IaC can be used to automate the backup and recovery of data, in which the procedures can be defined in the code, which will be triggered in the event of a disaster to ensure data is restored.
### Failover Automation
IaC can be used to automate the failover process so critical services can use the backup infrastructure which reduces downtime.
### Configuration Consistency
IaC keeps infrastructure consistent and well-documented; this consistency is vital during the disaster recovery process and helps avoid misconfigurations (often caused by lack of documentation) during the transition to backup environment.
### Scaling Resources
The recovery process can be resource intensive, and IaC can be used to scale resources to handle the increased workloads (and scale back down afterwards).
