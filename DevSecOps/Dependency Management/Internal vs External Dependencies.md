## Internal Dependencies
An internal dependency is one that has been developed internally. These dependencies are usually only used by the applications that are internally developed by an organization. Some examples of internal dependencies include:
- An authentication library that standardizes the authentication processes of all the internally developed applications.
- A data-source connection library that provides applications with various techniques to connect to different data sources.
- A message translation library that can convert application messages from a specific format to one that a different internal application can read.
## External Dependencies
An external dependency is one that has been developed and maintained outside of the organization. Usually, these dependencies are publicly available (some are free, but some can be paid for SDKs). Some examples of popular external dependencies include:
- Any Python pip package that you install from the PyPi public repositories.
- JQuery and any other publicly available Node Package Manager (NPM) libraries, such as VueJS or NodeJS.
- Paid for SDKs such as Google's ReCaptcha SDK that can be used to integrate captchas into your application.
