## ATT&CK Framework
The ATT&CK Framework stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, was developed in 2013.

It's purpose is to record and document common tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) groups against enterprise Windows networks.

This framework started as an internal project known as Fort Meade Experiment (FMX), in which selected security professionals were assigned to emulate adversarial TTPs against a network, and data was collected from the attacks on the network.

The framework is heavily contributed to by many sources, such as security researchers and threat intelligence reports This framework is useful for both red teamers and blue teamers.

It is a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targete
