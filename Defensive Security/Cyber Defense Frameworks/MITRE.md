## Introduction
From [**Mitre.org**](https://www.mitre.org/about/corporate-overview): "_At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation._"
## ATT&CK Framework
The ATT&CK Framework stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, was developed in 2013.

It's purpose is to record and document common tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) groups against enterprise Windows networks.

This framework started as an internal project known as Fort Meade Experiment (FMX), in which selected security professionals were assigned to emulate adversarial TTPs against a network, and data was collected from the attacks on the network.

The framework is heavily contributed to by many sources, such as security researchers and threat intelligence reports This framework is useful for both red teamers and blue teamers.
## CAR Knowledge Base
The Cyber Analytics Repository is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE and is based upon the MITRE ATT&CK adversary model.

It is a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics.
## ENGAGE
Per the website, "_MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals._"

MITRE Engage is considered an Adversary Engagement Approach. This is accomplished by the implementation of Cyber Denial and Cyber Deception.

With Cyber Denial we prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations and with Cyber Deception we intentionally plant artifacts to mislead the adversary.

This framework consists of the following categories:
- **Prepare** the set of operational actions that will lead to your desired outcome (input)
- **Expose** adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities 
- **Affect** adversaries by performing actions that will have a negative impact on their operations
- **Elicit** information by observing the adversary and learn more about their modus operandi (TTPs)
- **Understand** the outcomes of the operational actions (output)
## D3FEND
D3FEND stands for Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense. It is a knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures.

D3FEND is still in beta and is funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA.
## AEP
AEP stands for ATT&CK® Emulation Plans. These are step-by-step guide on how to mimic the specific threat group, designed to help defenders to more effectively test their networks and defenses by enabling red teams to more actively model adversary behavior, as described by ATT&CK
