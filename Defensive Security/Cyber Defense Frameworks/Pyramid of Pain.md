## Introduction
The Pyramid of Pain is a conceptual model which may be used to detect indicators of compromised and actions of attackers. It can be used to improve the effectiveness of Cyber Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, and Threat Hunting.
## Hash Values (Trivial)
A hash value is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data. It is the result of a hashing algorithm. Security professionals usually use the hash values to gain insights into a specific malware sample, a malicious or a suspicious file, and as a way to unique identify and reference the malicious artifact.

A hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if two files have the same hash value or digest.

Various online tools can be used to do hash lookups like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) and [Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/?lang=en).
