## Introduction
The Unified Kill Chain, published in 2017, provides deeper insights into each stage of an attack by linking specific techniques from the ATT&CK framework to each phase of the traditional kill chain (Cyber Kill Chain).

The UKC states that there are 18 phases to an attack: Everything from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding an attacker's motive. These phases have been grouped together in this note into a few areas of focus for brevity, which will be detailed in the remaining tasks.
