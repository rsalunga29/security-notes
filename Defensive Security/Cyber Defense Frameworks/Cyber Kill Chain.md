## Introduction
The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework created by Lockheed Martin for the cybersecurity industry in 2011. It is based on the "kill chain" military concept. The framework defines the steps used by adversaries or threat actors in the cyberspace. For an adversary to succeed, an adversary needs to go through all phases of the Kill Chain.
## Importance
The Cyber Kill Chain helps defenders understand and protect against ransomware attacks, security breaches, and attacks from Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The Kill Chain can be used to assess the security of your network and systems by identifying missing security controls and closing certain security gaps in your infrastructure.

Essentially, understand the kill chain helps defenders, such as SOC Analysts, Threat Hunters, Incident Responders, and Security Researchers, recognize the intrusion attempts and understand the intruder's goals and objectives.
## Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim. The reconnaissance phase is the planning phase for the adversaries.

OSINT or open-source intelligence falls under recon phase. It is usually the first step an adversary needs to complete to carry our further phases of an attack.
