## Introduction
The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis is a framework developed by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz in 2013. It's composed of four core features: Adversary, Infrastructure, Capability, and Victim.

The Diamond Model carries the essential concepts of identifying and analyzing intrusion and adversary operations while allowing the flexibility to expand and integrate new ideas and concepts. It also provides various opportunities to integrate intelligence in real-time for network defense, automating correlation across events, classifying events with confidence into adversary campaigns, and forecasting adversary operations while planning and gaming mitigation strategies.
## Adversary
The term adversary in this model, is an actor or organization responsible for utilizing a capability against the victim to achieve their intent. It is also known as an attacker, enemy, cyber threat actor, or hacker. The adversary is the person who stands behind the cyberattack.

Adversary knowledge can generally be mysterious, and this core feature is likely to be empty for most events – at least at the time of discovery.

It is often difficult to identify an adversary during the initial stages of a cyber attack. However, by utilizing data collected from an incident or breach, artifacts or signatures, and other relevant information, we may be able to determine who the adversary might be.
### Adversary Operator
An adversary operator is the "hacker" or person(s) conducting the intrusion activity.
### Adversary Customer
An adversary customer is an entity that stands to benefit from the activity conducted in the intrusion. It may be the same person who stands behind the adversary operator, or it may be a separate person or group.
## Victim
A victim is the target of the adversary. It can be a person, organization, target email addresses, IP addresses, domains, etc.

A victim can be an opportunity for the attackers to get a foothold on the organization they are trying to attack. There is always a victim in every cyberattack.
### Victim Personae
A victim personae are the people and organizations being targeted and whose assets are being attacked and exploited.
### Victim Assets
A victim assets are the attack surface and includes the victim's systems, networks, email addresses, IP addresses, user account, etc., to which the adversary will direct their capabilities.
## Capability
Capability is the skill, tools, and techniques used by the adversary in the intrusion activity. The capability also highlights the adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

The capabilities can be malware and phishing email development skills or, at least, access to capabilities, such as acquiring malware or ransomware as a service.
### Capability Capacity
Refers to all of the vulnerability and weaknesses that the individual capability can use.
### Adversary Arsenal
Refers to the set of capabilities that belong to an adversary. The combined capacities of an adversary's capabilities make it the adversary's arsenal.
## Infrastructure
