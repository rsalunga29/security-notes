The investigation process identifies communicated hosts in terms of time, frequency, protocol, application, and data. It tries to answer the **5Ws**:
- **Who**: Source IP and port
- **What**: Data and payload
- **Where**: Destination IP and port
- **When**: Time and data
- **Why**: How and what happened
## Data Types to Investigate
There are three main data types investigated in network forensics:
- Live Traffic
- Traffic Captures (full packet captures and network flows)
- Log Files
## Sources of Evidences
The following are some evidence resources to gather forensics data that will be useful in an investigation:
- TAPS
- InLine Devices
- SPAN Ports
- Hubs
- Switches
- Routers
- DHCP Servers
- Name Servers
- Authentication Servers
- Firewalls
- Web Proxies
- Central Log Servers
- Logs (IDS/IPS, Application, OS, Device)
