Traffic Analysis is a method of intercepting, recording/monitoring, and analyzing network data and communication patterns to detect and respond to system health issues, network anomalies, and threats.

Traffic analysis is one of the essential approaches used in network security, and is part of a multi-discipline network security operations:
- Network Sniffing and Packet Analysis
- Network Monitoring
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention
- Network Forensics
- Threat Hunting

Benefits of the Traffic Analysis:
- Provides full network visibility.
- Helps comprehensive baselining for asset tracking.
- Helps to detect/respond to anomalies and threats.
## Flow Analysis
Collecting data/evidence from the networking devices. This type of analysis aims to provide statistical results without applying in-depth packet-level investigation.

**Advantage**: Easy to collection and analyze.
**Challenge**: Doesn't provide full packet details to get the root cause of the alert.
## Packet Analysis
Collecting all available network data. Applies in-depth packet-level investigation (a.k.a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)) to detect and block anomalous and malicious packets.

**Advantage**: Provides full packet details to get the root cause of the alert.
**Challenge**: Difficult, and requires time and skillset to analyze.
