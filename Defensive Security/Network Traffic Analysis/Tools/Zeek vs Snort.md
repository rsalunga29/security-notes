While both are called IDS/NIDS and there are some overlapping functionalities, they have different purposes for usage.

| **Capabilities**    | NSM and IDS framework. It is heavily focused on network analysis. It is more focused on specific threats to trigger alerts. The detection mechanism is focused on events.                                          | An IDS/IPS system. It is heavily focused on signatures to detect vulnerabilities. The detection mechanism is focused on signature patterns and packets. |
| **Cons**            | Hard to use.<br><br>The analysis is done out of the Zeek, manually or by automation.                                                                                                                               | Hard to detect complex threats.                                                                                                                         |
| **Pros**            | It provides in-depth traffic visibility.<br><br>Useful for threat hunting.<br><br>Ability to detect complex threats.<br><br>It has a scripting language and supports event correlation. <br><br>Easy to read logs. | Easy to write rules.<br><br>Cisco supported rules.<br><br>Community support.                                                                            |
| **Common Use Case** | Network monitoring.  <br>In-depth traffic investigation.  <br>Intrusion detecting in chained events.                                                                                                               | Intrusion detection and prevention.  <br>Stop known attacks/threats.                                                                                    |
