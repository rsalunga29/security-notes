Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring and traffic analysis tool. It is a passive network traffic analyzer used as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations.

Zeek differs from known monitoring and IDS/IPSÂ tools by providing a wide range of detailed logs ready to investigate both for forensics and data analysis actions. Currently, there are 50+ logs in 7 categories that are available.
