## Introduction
Snort is an open-source Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team.

Snort uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generate alerts for the users.
