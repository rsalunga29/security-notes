Network Forensics is a specific subdomain of the Forensics domain and focuses on network traffic investigation. It is an action of recording packets of network traffic and creating investigable sources and establishing a root-cause analysis of an event.

The goal is to provide sufficient information to detect malicious activities, security breaches, policy/regulation compliance, system health, and user behavior.
## Use Cases
The most common network forensic use cases are:
- **Network Discovery**: Discovering the network to overview connected devices, rogue hosts and network load.
- **Packets Reassembling**: Reassembling packets to investigate the (unencrypted) traffic flow.
- **Data Leakage Detection**: Review packet transfer for each host and destination address to detect possible data leakage.
- **Anomaly and Malicious Activity Detection**: Review overall network load and activity to detect possible malicious activities along with vulnerabilities. This use case covers the correlation of indicators and hypotheses.
- **Policy/Regulation Compliance Control**: Review overall network behavior to detect policy/regulation compliance.
## Sources of Evidences
There are multiple evidence resources to gather network forensics data:
- TAPS
- InLine Devices
- SPAN Ports
- Hubs
- Switches
- Routers
- DHCP Servers
- Name Servers
- Authentication Servers
- Firewalls
- Web Proxies
- Central Log Servers
- Logs (IDS/IPS, Application, OS, Device)
