As per Microsoft Internals 6th Edition, "_The System process (process ID 4) is the home for a special kind of thread that runs only in kernel mode a kernel-mode system thread. System threads have all the attributes and contexts of regular user-mode threads (such as a hardware context, priority, and so on) but are different in that they run only in kernel-mode executing code loaded in system space, whether that is in Ntoskrnl.exe or in any other loaded device driver. In addition, system threads don't have a user process address space and hence must allocate any dynamic storage from operating system memory heaps, such as a paged or nonpaged pool._"
## User mode
When you launch an application in user mode, Windows creates a process for it. This process provides the application with a private virtual address space and a private handle table. Since each application's virtual address space is private, one application can't modify another application's data. Each application runs in isolation, ensuring that if one crashes, it doesn't affect other applications or the operating system.
