Also known as CTI or Threat Intelligence (TI), is the evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, TTPs, motivations, and actionable advise against them. Defenders uses CTI to make better decisions regarding their defensive strategy, and investigate and report against adversary attacks.

The primary goal of CTI is to:
1. Understand the relationship between your environment and your adversary and how to defend against them.
2. Make the information actionable.

Defenders would typically try to answer the following questions to develop their cyber threat context:
1. Who’s attacking you?
2. What are their motivations?
3. What are their capabilities?
4. What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?
## Data vs Information vs Intelligence
### Data
Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.
### Information
A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as “How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the month?”
### Intelligence
The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.
## Intelligence Sources
### Internal
- Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
- Cyber awareness training reports.
- System logs and events.
### Community
- Open web forums.
- Dark web communities for cybercriminals.
### External
- Threat intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source).
- Online marketplaces.
- Public sources including government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.
## Intelligence Classifications
### Strategic Intel
High-level intel that looks into the organization's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns, and emerging threats.
### Technical Intel
Evidence and artifacts from an attack used by the adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyze and develop defense mechanisms.
### Tactical Intel
Assesses the adversaries' TTPs. This intel can help strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through threat hunting and real-time investigations.
### Operational Intel
Looks into an adversary’s specific motives and intent to perform an attack.
