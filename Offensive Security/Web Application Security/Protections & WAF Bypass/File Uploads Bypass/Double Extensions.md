Some validation function only tests whether the filename contains an extension. A straightforward method of passing the validation function (assume its using regex) is through Double Extensions. For example, if the `.jpg` extension was allowed, we can add it in our uploaded file name and still end our filename with `.php` (e.g. `shell.jpg.php`), in which case we should be able to pass the whitelist test, while still uploading a PHP script that can execute PHP code.
