File signatures or magic bytes are the first few bytes of a file's content which determine their file type. For example, if a file starts with `GIF87a` or `GIF89a` which has a hex representation of `47 49 46 38 37 61` and `47 49 46 38 39 61` respectively, this indicates that it is a GIF image, while a file starting with plain text is usually considered a Text file.

If we changed the first bytes of any file to the GIF magic bytes, its MIME type would be changed to a GIF image, regardless of its remaining content or extension. Changing the bytes of any file can be done by tools such as [Hexedit NCurses](https://www.kali.org/tools/ncurses-hexedit/).
