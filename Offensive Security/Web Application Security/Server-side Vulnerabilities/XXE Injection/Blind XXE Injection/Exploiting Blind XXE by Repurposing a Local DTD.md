Another way of exploiting blind XXD is through the repurposing a local DTD. This is because the usage of an external DTD is not permitted when an internal DTD is already specified within the `DOCTYPE` element.
## Locating an existing DTD file to repurpose
Since this attack involves repurposing an existing DTD within the server filesystem, a key requirement is to locate a suitable file. This is actually straightforward, because an application might return any error messages thrown by the XML parser, which can be used to enumerate local DTD files just by attempting to load them from within the internal DTD.

For example, Linux systems using the GNOME desktop environment often have a DTD file at `/usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd`. Submit the following XXE payload to test if this file is present:
```dtd
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ENTITY % local_dtd SYSTEM "file:///usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd">
%local_dtd;
]>
```
