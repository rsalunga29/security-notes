An attacker can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that can be retrieved through the browser. For example, an application serves static resources at `/var/www/html/assets`, the attacker can then submit the following input:
```txt
& whoami > /var/www/html/assets/whoami.txt &
```
The attacker can open the browser to fetch `https://target-website.com/assets/whoami.txt` to retrieve the file and view the output of the injected command.

This exploit works if the target website has writable directories that can also be accessed by an attacker through the browser.
