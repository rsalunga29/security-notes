An attacker can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that can be retrieved through the browser. For example, an application serves static resources at `/var/www/html/assets`, the attacker can then submit the following input:
```txt
& whoami > /var/www/html/assets/whoami.txt &
```
