An attacker can use a command to trigger a time delay, enabling them to confirm that the command was executed based on the time the application responds. The `ping` command is a good way to do this, because it has a parameter that specify the number of ICMP packets to send:
```nix
& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
```
This will cause the application to ping its loopback network adapter for 10 seconds.
