OS Command Injection also known as Shell Injection, is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that the application is running on, which typically leads to a full compromise of the application and its data. Often, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to compromise other parts of the infrastructure and even pivot the attack to other systems within the organization.
