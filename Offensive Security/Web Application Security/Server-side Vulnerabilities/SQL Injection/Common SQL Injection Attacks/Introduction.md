There are lots of SQL injection vulnerabilities, attacks, and techniques, that occur in different situations.

Most SQL injection vulnerability occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. However, it can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations are:
- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.
