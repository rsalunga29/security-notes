Conceptually, authentication vulnerabilities are easy to understand. However, they are usually critical because of the clear relationship between authentication and security.

Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits. For this reason, it's important to learn how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, and how to bypass common protection measures.
## Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username `carlos` is really the same person who created the account.

Once `carlos` has been authenticated, their permissions will determine what they are authorized to do, such as accessing or modifying another user's personal information.
## Brute Force Attacks
A brute force attack is an attack when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials. These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords, and using dedicated tools, enabling the attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.
