LFI attacks can come in different shapes. Another common, and a little bit more advanced, LFI attack is a `Second Order Attack`. This occurs because many web application functionalities may be insecurely pulling files from the back-end server based on user-controlled parameters.

For example, a web application may allow us to download our avatar through a URL like (`/profile/$username/avatar.png`). If we craft a malicious LFI username (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), then it may be possible to change the file being pulled to another local file on the server and grab it instead of our avatar.
