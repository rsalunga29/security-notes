The same technique can also be used to perform code executions.

While we can use many different methods to execute remote commands depending on the backend language/framework and the vulnerable function's capabilities. The most command method for gaining control over the backend server is by enumerating for user credentials and SSH keys, and then use those to login to the backend server through SSH or any remote session.
