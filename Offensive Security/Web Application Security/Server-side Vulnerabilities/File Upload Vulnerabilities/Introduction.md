File upload vulnerabilities arises when a web server allows users to upload files into its filesystem without validating things like the name, filetype, contents, or size. Failing to enforce restrictions could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead.

For example, failing to validate file types can allow an attacker to upload certain file types (such as `.php` and `.jsp`) which are web shells that enable remote code execution (RCE) resulting in an attacker taking full control of the server.

In some cases, the act of uploading a file in itself is enough to cause damage, as it can allow an attacker to overwrite critical server files simply by uploading a file with the same name. If the server is vulnerable to [directory traversal](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FServer-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FPath%20Traversal%2FIntroduction), attackers can also even upload files to unexpected locations. This is caused by failure to validate the filename.

Finally, failing to make sure that the size of the file falls within an expected thresholds could fill available disk space, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
