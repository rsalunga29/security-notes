Even the most exhaustive blacklists can potentially be bypassed by using classic obfuscation techniques. For example, a validation code might fail to recognize that `exploit.pHp` is a valid `.php` file, which may lead the server to execute the script. This is caused by validation codes failing to map the file extension to a MIME type that is not case sensitive.

You can also achieve similar results using the following techniques:
- Provide multiple extensions. Depending on the algorithm used to parse the filename, the following file may be interpreted as either a PHP file or JPG image: `exploit.php.jpg`
- Add trailing characters. Some components will strip or ignore trailing whitespaces, dots, and suchlike: `exploit.php.`
- Try using the URL encoding (or double URL encoding) for dots, forward slashes, and backward slashes. If the value isn't decoded when validating the file extension, but is later decoded server-side, this can also allow you to upload malicious files that would otherwise be blocked: `exploit%2Ephp`
- Add semicolons or URL-encoded null byte characters before the file extension. If validation is written in a high-level language like PHP or Java, but the server processes the file using lower-level functions in C/C++, for example, this can cause discrepancies in what is treated as the end of the filename: `exploit.asp;.jpg` or `exploit.asp%00.jpg`
- Try using multibyte unicode characters, which may be converted to null bytes and dots after unicode conversion or normalization. Sequences like `xC0 x2E`, `xC4 xAE` or `xC0 xAE` may be translated to `x2E` if the filename parsed as a UTF-8 string, but then converted to ASCII characters before being used in a path.
- Some defenses involves stripping or replacing dangerous file extensions and fails apply the transformation recursively leaving behind a valid file extension, which leads to the following filename `exploit.p.phphp` being executed.
