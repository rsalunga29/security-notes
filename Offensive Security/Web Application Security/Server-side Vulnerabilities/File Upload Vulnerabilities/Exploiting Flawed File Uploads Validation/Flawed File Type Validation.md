When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in `POST` HTTP request with the `Content-Type` value of `application/x-www-form-url-encoded`. Most of the time this works, however it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an image or PDF file. In this case the `multipart/form-data` is more suitable.

Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting the form will result in a request like this:
```http
POST /images HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 12345
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[...binary content of example.jpg...]

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

This is an interesting description of my image.

---------------------------012345678901234567890123456
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

```
Notice that the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs, where each part contains `Content`
