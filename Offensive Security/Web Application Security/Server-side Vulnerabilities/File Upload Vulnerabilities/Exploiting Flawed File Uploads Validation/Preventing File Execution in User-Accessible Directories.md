While it's clearly better to prevent dangerous filetypes to be uploaded in the first place, the second line of defense is to stop the server from executing any scripts that slip through the first line of filtering.

As a precaution, servers generally only run scripts whose MIME type have been whitelisted. Otherwise, they may just return some kind of an error message, or in some cases, serve the contents of the file in plain text instead:
```http
GET /static/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
```
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 39

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```
