If a web application allows `.zip` files to be uploaded and processes its contents by unzipping. An attacker can abuse this functionality by using symlink to read arbitrary files on the server that is running the application.

## Remediation
The web application should filter out any symlinks included inside the ZIP files by checking the file extension.
