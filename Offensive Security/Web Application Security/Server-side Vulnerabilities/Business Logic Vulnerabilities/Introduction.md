Business logic vulnerabilities, also known as "application logic vulnerabilities", or "simply logic flaws", are flaws in the design and implementation of an application, that allows an attacker to elicit unintended behavior from legitimate functionalities to achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual user behavior and application states that may occur, and consequently, failing to handle them safely.

Logic flaws are often invisible to users who normally use the applications. However, an attacker may exploit behavioral quirks by interacting with the application in ways that developers never intended.
## Note
In this context, the term "business logic" simply refers to the set of rules that define how the application operates.

The main purpose of "business logic" to enforce rules and constraints that were defined when designing the application of functionality. Broadly speaking, these rules dit
