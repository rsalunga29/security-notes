Manually identifying gadget chains can be fairly be a hard process, and is almost impossible without source code access. However, there are some tools that provide a pre-build gadget chains any attacker can use.

These tools provides a range of pre-discovered chains that have been successfully exploited in the wild.
## ysoserial
One such tool for Java deserialization is "ysoserial", which lets an attacker choose one of the provided gadget chains they think the target application is using, then pass in a command that they want to execute:
```bash
java -jar \
--add-opens=java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED \
--add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED \
ysoserial-all.jar CommonsCollections4 "id" | base64 -w 0 > exploit.txt
```

Not all gadget chains in ysoserial allows an attacker to run an arbitrary code. Instead, they may be used for other purposes, such as:
- The `URLDNS` chain triggers a DNS lookup for a specified URL. This chain does not rely on the target application using a vulnerable library, instead it works in any known Java version. Due to this, this makes it the most universal gadget chain for detection purposes. Attackers can use this chain to generate an object that triggers a DNS interaction on a server they control, if it does, it's a proof that deserialization occurred on their target.
- The `JRMPClient` is another universal chain that can be used for initial detection. This chain try to establish a TCP connection to the supplied IP address (this does not work with a hostname). This chain is useful when outbound traffic is firewalled, including DNS lookups. If the application responds immediately for a payload with a local address, but hands for a payload containing external address, it indicates the gadget chain works. Due to this, this can also be used for detecting "blind" deserializations.
## PHP Generic Gadget Chains (PHPGGC)
For PHP-based websites, an attacker can use the PHPGGC.
```bash
./phpggc Symfony/RCE4 exec 'id' | base64 -w 0 > exploit.txt
```
