A "gadget" is a snippet of code that exists in the application that an attacker can leverage for a successful exploit. While individual gadgets may not directly do anything harmful, an attacker can chain multiple gadgets to invoke a method that will pass their payload into a dangerous "sink gadget", where it can cause maximum damage.

A gadget chain is not a payload of chained methods constructed by an attacker, as all of the code already exists in the application. The only thing an attacker controls is the data that is passed into the gadget chain. This is typically done using a magic method that is invoked during deserialization, sometimes known as a "kick-off gadget".

> It is important to note that the vulnerability is the deserialization of user-controllable data, not the mere presence of a gadget chain in the website's code or any of its libraries. The gadget chain is just a means of manipulating the flow of the harmful data once it has been injected.
