An application's functionality might also perform dangerous operations using data from a deserialized object.

In this example, the app's "Delete user" functionality also deletes the user's profile picture by accessing the file path in `$user->image_location` attribute. If the `$user` was created from a serialized object, an attacker could exploit this by manipulating the `image_location` to set it into an arbitrary file path. This would result in their account and the arbitrary file being deleted.
