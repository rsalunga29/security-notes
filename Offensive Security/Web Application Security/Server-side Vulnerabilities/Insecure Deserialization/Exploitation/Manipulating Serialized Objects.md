Simply changing an attribute in a serialized object is one of the most basic deserialization exploit. As the object state is persisted, study the serialized data to identify and edit interesting values, a malicious object can then be passed into the application via its deserialization process.

This exploit can be approached in two ways: edit the object directly in its byte stream form, or write a short script in the corresponding language to create and serialized the new object.
