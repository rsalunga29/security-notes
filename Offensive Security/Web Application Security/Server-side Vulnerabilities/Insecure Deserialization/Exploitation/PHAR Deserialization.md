In PHP, it is sometimes possible to exploit deserialization even if there is no `unserialize()` method. Deserialization can also happen when the PHP wrapper `phar://` is used, which provides a stream interface for accessing PHP Archive (`.phar`) files.

According to PHP documentation, `PHAR` manifest files contain serialized metadata. Meaning, every time an application performs any filesystem operation on a `phar://` stream, the metadata is implicitly being deserialized. This means, that `phar://` can potentially be a vector for exploiting insecure deserialization, provided that an attacker can pass the stream into a filesystem method.

Filesystem methods such as `include()` or `fopen()` are obviously dangerous and are likely to have countermeasures implemented to reduce the potential for them to be used maliciously. However, methods such as `file_exists()`, may not have such countermeasures.

This technique requires the attacker to upload a `PHAR` to the server. One approach they can use is to upload it via an image upload functionality. If they can create a polyglot file, with a `PHAR`
