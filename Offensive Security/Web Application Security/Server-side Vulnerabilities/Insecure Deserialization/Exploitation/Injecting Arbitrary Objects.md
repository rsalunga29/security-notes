In OOP, the methods available to an object are determined by its class. Therefore, if an attacker is able to manipulate which class of object is being passed in as serialized data, they can influence what code is executed during or after the deserialization process.

This attack method can open up many more exploit possibilities within an application. Since deserialization methods usually do not check for the object or class type of the data they are deserializing. An attacker can pass objects of any serializable class that is available to the application, allowing them to create instances of arbitrary classes.

While the unexpected object type might cause an exception in the application logic, the malicious object would have already been instantiated by then (magic methods).
