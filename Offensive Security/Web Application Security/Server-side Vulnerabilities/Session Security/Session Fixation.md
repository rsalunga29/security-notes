A token should expire after the user has been inactive for a given amount of time, for example, after 1 hour, and should expire even if there is activity after a given amount of time, such as 24 hours. Additionally, if the user gets more grants during a sudo-like session, the token must change. If a token never expires or changes, it might be prone to a session fixation attack.

Session fixation is an attack carried out by tricking or phishing a user to use a link that has a predefined session ID that is unknown to the application. When the user logs in to the vulnerable web application using the predefined session ID, the attacker can now proceed to a [Session Hijacking attack](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FServer-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FSession%20Security%2FSession%20Hijacking).
