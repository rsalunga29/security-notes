When an attacker is able to compromise and gain foothold on a server, session IDs and session data can be retrieved from either the server's disk or memory.
## PHP
Let us look at where PHP session identifiers are usually stored.

The entry `session.save_path` in `PHP.ini` specifies where session data will be stored.
```bash
cat /etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini | grep 'session.save_path'
cat /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini | grep 'session.save_path'
```
Once an attacker have identified where sessions are being saved, all they have to do is use the `cat` command to read its contents.
## Java
According to the Apache Software Foundation:

"The `Manager` element represents the _session manager_ that is used to create and maintain HTTP sessions of a web application.

Tomcat provides two standard implementations of `Manager`. The default implementation stores active sessions, while the optional one stores active sessions that have been swapped out (in addition to saving sessions across a server restart) in a storage location that is selected via the use of an appropriate `Store` nested element. The filename of the default session data file is `SESSIONS.ser`."
## .NET
For .NET applications, session IDs are stored in:
- The application worker process (aspnet_wp.exe) - This is the case in the _InProc Session mode_
- StateServer (A Windows Service residing on IIS or a separate server) - This is the case in the _OutProc Session mode_
- An SQL Server
## Database
In cases where we are able to have access to the database, either via SQL injection or identified credentials, we must always look for stored credentials. Utilizing the SQL language, we will look through databases and tables that might store session IDs and session data.
