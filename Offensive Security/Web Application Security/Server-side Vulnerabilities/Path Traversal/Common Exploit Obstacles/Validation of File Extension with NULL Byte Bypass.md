In this case, an application may require the user-supplied value to end with an expected file extension such as `.png`.

To bypass this, it might be possible to use a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example:
```txt
https://target-website.com?filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
```
