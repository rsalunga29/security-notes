In this case, an application may require the user-supplied value to start with the expected base folder e.g `/var/www/html/images`.

To bypass this, it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences, for example:
```txt
https://target-website.com?filename=/var/www/html/images/../../../etc/passwd
```
