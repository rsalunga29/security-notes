Reset tokens (in the form of a code or temporary password) are secret pieces of data generated mainly by the application when a password reset is requested. A user must provide it to prove their identity before actually changing their credentials. This function allows us to reset the actual password of the user without knowing the password.

A password reset flow may seem complicated since it usually consists of several steps. See image below for an example of a simple password reset flow:
