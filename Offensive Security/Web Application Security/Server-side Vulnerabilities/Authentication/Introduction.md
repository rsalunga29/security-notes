Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

There are three main types of authentication:
- **Something you know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
- **Something you have**, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
- **Something you are or do**. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

Conceptually, authentication vulnerabilities are easy to understand. However, they are usually critical because of the clear relationship between authentication and security.

Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits. For this reason, it's important to learn how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, and how to bypass common protection measures.
## Causes
Most authentication vulnerabilities occur in one of two ways:
- The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute force attacks
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanism to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes known as "broken authentication".
