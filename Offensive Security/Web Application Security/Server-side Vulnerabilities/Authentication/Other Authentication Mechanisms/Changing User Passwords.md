Typically, changing your password involves verifying your current password and then entering a new password twice. This functionality typically rely on the same process for checking that a username and a password credentials match, just like a normal login page does. Therefore, these functionalities can be vulnerable to the same techniques.

Password change functionality can be dangerous if it allows an attacker to access it directly without being authenticated. For example, if the username is provided in a hidden field, an attacker can change this value and change the password of any user. Alternatively, an attacker can conduct a username enumeration and brute force passwords.
