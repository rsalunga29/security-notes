Usernames are specially easy to guess if they confirm to a recognizable pattern, such as an email address. For example, it is very common for businesses to implement email address formats for their employees - `firstname.lastname@company.com`. However, even if there is no obvious patterns, some high-privileged accounts are created to use predictable usernames such as `admin` or `administrator`.

During audit, it is important to check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. For example, an attacker can access user profiles without logging in due to a [broken access control](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FServer-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FAccess%20Control%2FIntroduction). Even if the actual content of the profile is hidden, the name used in the profile is sometimes used as the login username. It is also worthwhile to check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed, as this can occasionally contain email addresses of high-privileged users, such as administrators or IT support.
