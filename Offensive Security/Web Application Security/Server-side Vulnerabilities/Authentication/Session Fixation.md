A token should expire after the user has been inactive for a given amount of time, for example, after 1 hour, and should expire even if there is activity after a given amount of time, such as 24 hours. Additionally, if the user gets more grants during a sudo-like session, the token must change. If a token never expires or changes, it might be prone to a session fixation attack.

Session fixation is an attack carried out by tricking or phishing a user to use a link that has a predefined session ID that is unknown to the application. When the user logs in to the vulnerable web application using the predefined session ID, the attacker can use this now valid session ID to impersonate the user and allow the attacker to take over a victimâ€™s session to steal confidential data, transfer funds, or completely take over a user account.
