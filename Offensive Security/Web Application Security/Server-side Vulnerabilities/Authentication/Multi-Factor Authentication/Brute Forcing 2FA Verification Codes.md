As with passwords, websites need to take steps to prevent brute forcing of the 2FA verification code. This is essentially important because the code is often a simple 4 or 6-digit number. Without adequate brute force protection, cracking such a code is trivial.

Some websites attempt to prevent this by automatically logging a user out if they enter a certain number of incorrect verification codes. This is ineffective in practice because an advanced attacker can even automate this multi-step process by creating macros for Burp Intruder, and/or using the Turbo Intruder extension.
