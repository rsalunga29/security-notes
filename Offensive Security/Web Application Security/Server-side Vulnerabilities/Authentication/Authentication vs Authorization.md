Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username `carlos` is really the same person who created the account.

Once `carlos` has been authenticated, their permissions will determine what they are authorized to do, such as accessing or modifying another user's personal information.
