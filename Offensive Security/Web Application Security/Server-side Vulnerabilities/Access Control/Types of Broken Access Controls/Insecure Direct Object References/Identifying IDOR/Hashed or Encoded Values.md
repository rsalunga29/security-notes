Some web applications may not use simple sequential numbers as object references but may encode the reference or hash it instead. If we find such parameters using encoded or hashed values, we may still be able to exploit them if there is no access control system on the back-end.

Supposed the reference was encoded using a common encoder, such as Base64. In that case we can decode it and view the object reference in plaintext, change its value, and then encode it again to access other data.

On the other hand, the object reference may be hashed, like (`download.php?filename=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c`). At a first glance, we may think that this is a secure object reference, as it is not using any clear text or easy encoding. However, if we look at the source code, we may see what is being hashed before the API call is made:
```javascript
$.ajax({
    url:"download.php",
    type: "post",
    dataType: "json",
    data: {filename: CryptoJS.MD5('file_1.pdf').toString()},
    success:function(result){
        //
    }
});
```
In this case, we can see that code uses the `filename` and hashing it with `CryptoJS.MD5`, making it easy for us to calculate the `filename` for other potential files.
