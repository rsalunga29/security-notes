Vertical access controls are mechanisms that restrict access to sensitive functionality to specify types of users.

With vertical access controls, different types of users have access to different application functions. For example, an admin might be able to modify or delete any user's account, while a regular user has no access to these types of actions.

Vertical access control can be more fine-grained implementations of security models designed to enforce business policies such as separation of duties and least privilege.
