After detecting that a potential vulnerability exists and successfully identifying the template engine, we can start exploiting it:
## Read
First step to do is to go through the templating engine documentation and learn the basic syntax, along with key functions and handling of variables. For example, if we know that the Python-based Mako template is being used, we can achieve remote code execution using the following basic payload:
```python
<%
	import os
	x=os.popen('id').read()
	%>

	${x}
```
In an unsandboxed environment, achieving remote code execution and using it to read, edit, or delete arbitrary files is similarly as simple in many common template engines.
