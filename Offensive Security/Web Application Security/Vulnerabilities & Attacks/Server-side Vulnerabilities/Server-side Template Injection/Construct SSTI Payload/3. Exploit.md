After detecting that a potential vulnerability exists and successfully identifying the template engine, we can start exploiting it:
## Read the Documentation
First step to do is to go through the templating engine documentation and learn the basic syntax, along with key functions and handling of variables. For example, if we know that the Python-based Mako template is being used, we can achieve remote code execution using the following basic payload:
```python
<%
	import os
	x=os.popen('id').read()
	%>

	${x}
```
In an non-sandboxed environment, achieving remote code execution and using it to read, edit, or delete arbitrary files is similarly as simple in many common template engines.
### Security Section
Additionally, the documentation also provides some sort of a security section, while the name may vary, it usually outlines all the potentially dangerous things that people should avoid doing with the template. This can be an invaluable resource, acting some kind of a cheat sheet for exploiting the template.

Even if there is no dedicated "Security" section, if a particular built-in object or function can pose a security risk, there is almost always a warning of some kind in the documentation. For example, in the ERB documentation, it reveals that you can list all the directories and read files as follows:
```html
<%= Dir.entries('/') %>
<%= File.open('/etc/passwd').read() %>
```
