The Web Services Description Language also known as WSDL is an XML-based file exposed by web services that informs clients of the provided services/methods, including where they reside and the method-calling convention.

A web service's WSDL file should not always be accessible. Developers may not want to publicly expose a web service's WSDL file, or they may expose it through an uncommon location, following a security through obscurity approach. In the latter case, directory/parameter fuzzing may reveal the location and content of a WSDL file.
