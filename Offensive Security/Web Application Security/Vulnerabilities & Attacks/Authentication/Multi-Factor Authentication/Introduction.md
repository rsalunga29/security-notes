Many websites rely exclusively on single-factor authentication using a password to authenticate users. However, some require users to prove their identity using multiple authentication factors.

Verifying biometric factors is impractical for most websites. However, it is increasingly common to see both mandatory and optional two-factor authentication (2FA) based on **something you know** and **something you have**. This usually requires a user to enter both a traditional password and a temporary verification code from an out-of-band physical device in their possession.

While it is sometimes possible for an attacker to obtain a knowledge-based factor, such as passwords, it is less likely that an attacker can also obtain an out-of-band source. For this reason, two-factor authentication is demonstrably more secure than single-factor authentication. However, as with any security measure, it is only ever as secure as its implementation, as poorly implemented two-factor authentication can be beaten and bypassed entirely.

The full benefits of multi-factor authentication are only achieved by verifying **multiple different** factors, as verifying the same factor in two different ways it not a true two-factor authentication.
