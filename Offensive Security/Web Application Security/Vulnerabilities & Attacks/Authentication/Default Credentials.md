It is common to find devices with `default credentials` due to human error or a breakdown in/lack of proper process. All penetration testers have witnessed such credentials stored on a Post-it note. This does not justify default credentials being used, though. A mandatory step of security hardening is changing default credentials and using strong passwords at an early stage of application deployment.

There is an old project, still maintained by CIRT.net and available as a [web database](https://www.cirt.net/passwords) used to collect default credentials split by vendors. Also, [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/default-passwords.csv) has a good list based on CIRT.net. The two options above have some overlap but also differences. It is a good idea to check both lists.
