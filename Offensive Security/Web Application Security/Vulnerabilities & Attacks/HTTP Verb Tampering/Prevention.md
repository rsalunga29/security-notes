To prevent web server misconfigurations resulting to HTTP Verb Tampering, always avoid restricting authorization to a particular HTTP method and always allow/deny all HTTP verbs and methods. Instead, if we want to specify a single method, we can use safe keywords, such as `LimitExcept` in Apache, `http-method-omission` in Tomcat, and `add`/`remove` in ASP.NET, which cover all verbs except the specified ones.

Additionally, we should also generally consider disabling/denying all `HEAD` requests unless specifically required by the web application.

To prevent HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, we have to make sure that we are consistent with the use of HTTP methods and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the application. It is always advised to expand the scope of testing in security filters by testing all request parameters. This can be done with the following functions and variables:

|Language|Function|
|---|---|
|PHP|`$_REQUEST['param']`|
|Java|`request.getParameter('param')`|
|C#|`Request['param']`|
