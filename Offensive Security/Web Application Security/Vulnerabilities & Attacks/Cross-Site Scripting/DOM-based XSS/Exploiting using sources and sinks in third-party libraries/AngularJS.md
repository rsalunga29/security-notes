If a framework like AngularJS is used, it may be possible to execute JavaScript without angle brackets or events. When a site uses the `ng-app` attribute on an HTML element, it will be processed by AngularJS. In this case, AngularJS will execute JavaScript inside double curly braces that can occur directly in HTML or inside attributes. For example:
```js
{{constructor.constructor('alert(document.domain)')()}}
```
