Testing for reflected XSS manually involves the following steps:
- **Test every entry point.** Separately test every entry point for data within the HTTP request. This includes parameters or other data in the URL query string and message body, and HTTP headers (although very unlikely to be exploitable in practice).
- **Submit random alphanumeric values.** For each entry point, submit a random value and determine whether the value is reflected in the response. A random alphanumeric value of around 8 characters is normally ideal.
- **Determine the reflection context.** For each location within the response where the random value is reflected, determine its context. This might be in text between HTML tags, within a tag attribute which might be quoted, within a JavaScript string, etc.
- **Test an initial payload.** Based on the context of the reflection, submit an initial payload that will trigger JavaScript execution if it is reflected unmodified within the response. An efficient way is to leave the original random value and place the payload before or after it.
- **Test alternative payloads.** If the initial payload was modified or completely blocked by the application, then it is a good idea to test alternative payloads and techniques to bypass validation and other defenses.
- **Test the attack in a browser.** If any payload successfully worked in Burp Repeater, transfer the attack to a real browser and see if the injected JavaScript is indeed executed.
