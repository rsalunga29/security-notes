If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can fully compromise that user. They can also do the following:
- Steal passwords and session IDs.
- Perform any action on behalf of the user.
- View/modify any information the user is able to view/modify.
- Initiate interaction with other users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.

There are various ways an attacker can do to deliver a reflected XSS attack. These includes placing links on a website that they control, or on another website that allows content to be posted, and sending a link in an email, tweet or other message.
