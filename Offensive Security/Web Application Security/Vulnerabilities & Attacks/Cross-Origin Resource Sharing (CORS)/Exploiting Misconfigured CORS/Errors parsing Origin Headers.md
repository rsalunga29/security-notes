Some applications that support access from multiple origins have a whitelist of allowed origins. So when a CORS request is received, the server will compare the requested origin to the whitelist. If the requested origin is in the whitelist, it will be reflected in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header then the access is granted.

Mistakes often arise when implementing such whitelists. Some organizations decide to allow access to all of their subdomains, including future ones not yet in existence. While some applications allow access from various other organization's domains including their subdomains. Such rules are often implemented by matching URL prefixes or suffixes, or using regular expressions. Any mistakes in these rules can lead to a CORS vulnerability.

For example, suppose an application grants access to all domains ending in:
```txt
normal-website.com
```
An attacker might be able to gain access by registering the domain:
```txt
hackersnormal-website.com
```
Alternatively, suppose an application grants access to all domains beginning with:
```txt
normal-website.com
```
An attacker might be able to gain access using the domain:
```txt
normal-website.com.evil-user.net
```
