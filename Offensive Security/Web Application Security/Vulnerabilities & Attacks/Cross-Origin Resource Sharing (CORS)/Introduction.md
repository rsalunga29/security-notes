Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located from another domain. While it extends and adds flexibility to the [Same-Origin Policy](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FClient-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FCross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20(CORS)%2FSame-origin%20Policy), it also provides a potential for cross-domain attacks if poorly configured and implemented.

CORS also does not provide protection against [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FClient-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FCross-site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF)%2FIntroduction) attacks, this is a common misconception. As poorly configured CORS may increase the possibility of CSRF attacks or worsen their impact.

There are also various ways to perform CSRF attacks without using CORS, including simple HTML forms and cross-domain resource includes.
