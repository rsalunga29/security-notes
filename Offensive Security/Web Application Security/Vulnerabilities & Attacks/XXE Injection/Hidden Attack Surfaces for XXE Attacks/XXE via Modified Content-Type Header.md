Most `POST` requests use a default `Content-Type` that is generated by HTML forms, such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Some websites expect to receive request in this format but will tolerate other content types, like XML.

For example, if a normal `POST` request contains the following:
```http
POST /action HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 7

foo=bar
```
Then you might be able to modify the request and submit it:
```http
POST /action HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 7

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><foo>bar</foo>
```
If the application tolerates requests containing XML in the message body, and parses the body content as XML, then you can reach the hidden XXE attack surface simply by reformatting requests to use the XML format.
