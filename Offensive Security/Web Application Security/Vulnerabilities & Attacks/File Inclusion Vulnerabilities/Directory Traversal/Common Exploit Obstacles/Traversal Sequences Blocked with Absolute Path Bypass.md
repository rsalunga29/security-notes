In this case, the application blocks traversal sequences - `../` and `..\` but treats the supplied filename as being relative to the default working directory.

We might be able to exploit this by using an absolute path from the filesystem root to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences:
```txt
https://target-website.com?filename=/etc/passwd
```
