Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users. Depending on the context, websites may leak all kinds of information to a potential attacker, including:
- Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information
- Sensitive commercial or business data
- Technical details about the website and its infrastructure

Add this: You can sometimes read source code by appending a tilde (`~)` to a filename to retrieve an editor-generated backup file.
