Virtually all modern websites are developed using some sort of a version control, such as Git. By default, a Git project stores all of its version control data in a folder called `.git`. Typically, this folder is omitted or access to it is restricted, but there will be websites that exposes this directory in the production environment.

If the `.git` folder is exposed, an attacker can access the website's source code and version history by simply browsing `/.git`. While it is impractical to manually browse the raw file structure and contents, there are various methods for downloading the `.git` directory, allowing the attacker to steal and review the source code, review logs and version history.
