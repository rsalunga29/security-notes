During development, comments are sometimes added to the source code by the developers. Typically, these comments are stripped before deployment to production. However, comments can also be forgotten, missed, or even left in deliberately because someone wasn't aware of the security implications.

While these comments may not be visible on the rendered page, they can be easily accessible using Burp or the browser's developer tools.

Occasionally, these comments contain information that is useful to an attacker. For example, they might hint at the existence of hidden directories or provide clues about the application logic.
