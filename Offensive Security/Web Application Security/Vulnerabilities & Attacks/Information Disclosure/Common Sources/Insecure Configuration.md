Websites are sometimes vulnerable due to improper configuration. This is especially common due to the widespread use of third-party technologies, whose configuration options are not necessarily well-understood by those implementing them.

There will also be cases in which developers forget to disable various debugging options in the production environment. For example, the HTTP method `TRACE` that is designed for debugging purposes. If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the TRACE method by echoing in its response the exact request that was received. If the application appends a custom header on the request, `TRACE` would reveal this to the attacker.
