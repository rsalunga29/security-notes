Preventing information disclosure completely is tricky due to the huge variety of ways in which it can occur. However, below are some of the general best practices:
- Make sure that everyone involved in creating the application is fully aware of what information is considered sensitive.
- Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of the development process.
- Use generic error messages as much as possible.
- Double check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in production environments.
- When adjusting configuration settings, make sure you fully understand what it is and its security implications.
