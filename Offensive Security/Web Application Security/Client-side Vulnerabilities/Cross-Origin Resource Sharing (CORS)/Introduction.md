<!-- @TODO: Link CSRF from Client-side vulnerabilities -->
Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. While it extends and adds flexibility to the [Same-Origin Policy](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FClient-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FCross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20(CORS)%2FSame-origin%20Policy), it also provides a potential for cross-domain attacks if poorly configured and implemented. CORS is also not a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
