<!-- @TODO: Link CSRF from Client-side vulnerabilities -->
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. While it extends and adds flexibility to the Same-Origin Policy, it also provides a potential for cross-domain attacks if poorly configured and implemented. CORS is also not a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
