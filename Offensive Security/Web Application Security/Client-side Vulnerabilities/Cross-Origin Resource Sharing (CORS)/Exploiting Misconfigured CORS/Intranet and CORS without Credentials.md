Most CORS attack rely on the presence of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` response header.

Without that header, the victim's user browser will refuse to send cookies. However, there is a common situation where an attacker can't access a website directly, and that is, when the website is part of the organization's intranet and located within a private IP address space.

Internal website or applications are often held to a lower security standards, enabling attackers to find vulnerabilities and gain further access. For example, a CORS request within a private network may be as follows:
```http
GET /reader?url=doc1.pdf
Host: intranet.normal-website.com
Origin: https://normal-website.com
```
And the server responds with:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```
