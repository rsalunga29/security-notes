Some applications need to provide access to a number of other domains. Since maintaining a list of allowed domains requires an ongoing effort, many take the easy route which adds more risk in creating mistakes that introduces a vulnerability.

One way developers do this is by reading the `Origin` HTTP header from requests and includes a response header stating that the requesting origin is allowed. For example:
```http
GET /sensitive-victim-data HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Cookie: sessionid=...
```
The server will then send a response like the following:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
...
```
