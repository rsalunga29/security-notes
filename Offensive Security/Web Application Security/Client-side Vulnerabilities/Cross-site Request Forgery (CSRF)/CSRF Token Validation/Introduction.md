A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with client. When performing a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request.

A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden form:
```html
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <label>Email</label>
    <input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
    <input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
    <button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```
Submitting this form will result in the following HTTP request:
```http
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 70
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

csrf=50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u&email=example@normal-website.com
```
When implemented correctly, CSRF tokens can protect against CSRF attacks by making it difficult for the attacker to construct a valid request.
## Note
CSRF tokens don't have to be sent as hidden parameters in a `POST` request. Some applications place CSRF tokens in HTTP headers, for example. The way in which tokens are transmitted has a significant impact on the security of a mechanism as a whole.
