Most websites nowadays implement defenses against CSRF. The most common defenses are as follows:
- **CSRF Tokens** - A unique, secret, and unpredictable token that is generated by the server-side application and shared with client. When performing a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request.
- **SameSite Cookies** - A browser security mechanism that determines a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. It also provides partial protection against cross-site leaks and some [CORS](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FClient-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FCross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20(CORS)%2FIntroduction) exploits.
- **Referer-based validation** - Some websites make use of the `Referer` HTTP header by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This is generally less effective than the CSRF token.
