Also known as CSRF, is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to partly circumvent the [Same-origin Policy](obsidian://open?vault=security-notes&file=Offensive%20Security%2FWeb%20Application%20Security%2FClient-side%20Vulnerabilities%2FCross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20(CORS)%2FSame-origin%20Policy%2FIntroduction) in order to cause a victim user to perform an action unintentionally. For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer.

<!-- @TODO: Link XSS -->
CSRF attacks are typically delivered the same way as reflected XSS, wherein the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a website that they control and induce the victims to visit that website. This might be done by feeding the user a link to the website, via email or social media message, or placing it into a popular website, in which case the attacker would just wait for users to visit the website.

Depending on the nature of the CSRF attack, the attacker might be able to gain full control over a user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role, the attacker might even be able to take full control of all of application's data and functionality.
