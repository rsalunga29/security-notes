Blind XSS vulnerabilities are a variant of stored XSS vulnerabilities. They occur when an attacker input is saved in the database and executed as a malicious script in another part of the application or in another application. For example, an attacker injects a malicious payload into a contact/feedback page and when the administrator of the application is reviewing the feedback entries the attackerâ€™s payload will be loaded.

Other example of web applications or pages where blind XSS may occur:
- Log viewers
- Exception handlers
- Chat applications / forums
- Customer ticket applications
- Product reviews
- Any application that requires user moderation by certain users (e.g Admins)
