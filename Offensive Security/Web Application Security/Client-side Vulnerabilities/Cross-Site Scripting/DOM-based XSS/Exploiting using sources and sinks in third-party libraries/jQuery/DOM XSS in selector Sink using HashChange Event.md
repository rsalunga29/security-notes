Another potential sink to look out for in jQuery is the `$()` selector function, which can be used to inject malicious objects in to the DOM.

Using the selector in conjunction with the `location.hash` source for auto-scroll animations can lead to DOM XSS, since this was almost always implemented using the vulnerable `hashchange` event handler, for example:
```js
$(window).on('hashchange', function () {
	var element = $(location.hash)
	element[0].scrollIntoView()
})
```
As the `location.hash` is user controllable, an attacker can inject an XSS vector into the `$()` selector sink.
