Another potential sink to look out for in jQuery is the `$()` selector function, which can be used to inject malicious objects in to the DOM.

Using the selector in conjunction with the `location.hash` source for auto-scroll animations can lead to DOM XSS, since this is almost always implemented using the vulnerable `hashchange` event handler, for example:
```js
$(window).on('hashchange', function () {
	var element = $(location.hash)
	element[0].scrollIntoView()
})
```
As the `location.hash` is user controllable, an attacker can inject an XSS vector into the `$()` selector sink. Exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker must trigger a `hashchange` event without user interaction, they can do this by delivering their exploit in an iframe. For example:
```html
<iframe src="https://vulnerable-website.com#" onload="this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>'">
```

*Note: More recent versions of jQuery have patched this particular vulnerability, but you might still find vulnerable code in the wild, provided you have full control over its  input from a source that doesn't require a `#` prefix.*
