In PHP there are four different ways to specify a string literal:
- single quoted
- double quoted
- heredoc syntax
- nowdoc syntax

It is common to use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quoted delimiters when working with type string. The main difference is that, with single-quoted (`'`), variables and escape sequence for special characters are not expanded, but with double-quoted (`"`), they are.
