URIs are fundamental elements of Internet communications. They provide a Uniform (local and remote), Resource Identifier
and are central in the web navigation system.

Sometimes, to exploit a vulnerability, one may require a degree of social engineering, making URI obfuscation very useful. Additionally, it can bypass some filtering systems but also shorten the payload to respect a length limit.
## URL Shortening
URL shortening is a technique in which a URL may be shorter in length and still direct to the required page.

Basically, an HTTP Redirect (301 Moved Permanently) header is sent from the domain name that is short to the web page that has a long URL.
