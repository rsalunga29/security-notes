Unicode (aka ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set) is the character encoding standard created to enable people around the world to use computers in any language. It supports all the world's writing systems. It can also expose web applications to possibly security attacks, 

There are three ways to map Unicode character points:
- UTF-8
- UTF-16
- UTF-32
> Note: UTF means Unicode Transformation Format and the trailing number indicates the number of bits to represent code points.
