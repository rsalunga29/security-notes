## Cloudwatch Automation
There's a way to automate response sa cloudwatch logs.

First find the outliers and i-automate. Outliers are:
1. Events with the most alerts
2. Events with the least alerts

Once na-automate na yun outliers, start working towards the middle, hanggang ma-automate na almost lahat ng alerts sa cloudwatch.
## Phishing Simulation
Different levels of complexity.

Parang easy, medium, hard sa complexity ng phishing simulation campaign.

Start na easy or very noob-friendly phishing campaign. Like asking them to click a button lang.

Then as your organization matures, mas nagiging complex yun phishing simulation.

Need rin ng punishment and reward for those who fail or pass the phishing simulation.
## Security Culture
Security culture is a set of ideas, norms, and social behaviors of an employee within an organizations.
