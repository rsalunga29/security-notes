## Cloudwatch Automation
There's a way to automate response sa cloudwatch logs.

First find the outliers and i-automate. Outliers are:
1. Events with the most alerts
2. Events with the least alerts

Once na-automate na yun outliers, start working towards the middle, hanggang ma-automate na almost lahat ng alerts sa cloudwatch.
## Phishing Simulation
Different levels of complexity.

Parang easy, medium, hard sa complexity ng phishing simulation campaign.

Start na easy or very noob-friendly phishing campaign. Like asking them to click a button lang.

Then as your organization matures, mas nagiging complex yun phishing simulation.

Need rin ng punishment and reward for those who fail or pass the phishing simulation.
## Security Culture
Security culture is a set of ideas, norms, and social behaviors that shape how an organization's employees engage with and take responsibility for security issues, their adherence to security policies, their proactive involvement in safeguarding data, and their commitment to maintaining a secure work environment.
## Security Assessment
Determine the goal. Is it to test the IR capability or improve defenses by looking for gaps.

Might need a dedicated purple team or red team based on the goal of the assessment.
